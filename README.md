# CiteIt.net Examples

This repo contains:

  - A form that submits a URL to Index a Page using the CiteIt.net webservice.
  - A form that submits a URL to generate a text version of a Page using the CiteIt.net webservice.
  - Several examples of quotations and the javascript libraries used to lookup their JSON files and display their context.

  
The JSON snippets that are retreived from the webservice are stored in CiteIt.net_json folder.

After you upload this folder you your web server, make sure that you grant your webserver permisssion to write to this folder so that index.php can save its JSON files to CiteIt.net_json .

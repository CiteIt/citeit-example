# CiteIt.net Examples

This repo contains:

  - A form that submits a URL to the CiteIt.net webservice.
  - Several examples of quotations and the javascript libraries used to lookup their JSON files and display their context.
  
The JSON snippets that are retreived from the webservice are stored in CiteIt.net_json folder.
